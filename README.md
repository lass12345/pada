Welcome!
This is a project for up skilling.

We will put in practice all the knowledge about javascript we will be learning together during the weeks.

The project will always be the same and we will learn how to do the same things with Vanilla JS and then with some javascript frameworks starting with Svelte.

The project - Pinpad

The BBVA bank wants to release a new pinpad for their sucursals.

The provider that makes the hardware of them, has more than 1000 pinpads ready to install in the sucursals but... they forgot some basic functionalities that the pinpads need to work properly.

BBVA decided to hire us in order to develop those functionalities:

Write the user code and show it in the display.
Security first! Each number clicked only will be visible for 2 seconds, then this character will return into "*"
If the user wants to show the introduced code, they need a new button üëÄ
The ‚úÖ button will check if the code introduced is correct. This button will be disabled in case that the user has no characters in the display and the number of characters is less than 4.
The ‚ùå button will clear the display. This button will be disabled in case that the user has no characters in the display.
While user is writing the code, could have a mistake. They will need a new button ‚¨ÖÔ∏è to remove the last character introduced. This button will be disabled in case that the user has no characters in the display.
If the code is wrong, a display message should appear in the display
If the code is ok, we will ask the user how much money he/she wants to get.
